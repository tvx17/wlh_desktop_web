# WLH - Writer's little helper
Desktop version
Web version

## What is this
I write books as my hobby. I have not been satisfied with the solutions that support me in this. One solution didn't offer this, the other solution didn't offer that.
So I started to write my own solution, which supports me from A to Z in writing my books.
The result was the idea for WLH (Writer's little helper).
Currently, the programme is still in development and hopefully there will be a first version soon.
